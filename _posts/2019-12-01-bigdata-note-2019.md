# 2019 bigdata technical notes #

## Hadoop HDFS

## HIVE data warehouse

## Spark computing engine

### csv / json data sources

you can read CSV / JSON files in single-line or multi-line mode. In single-line mode, a file can be split into many parts and read in parallel.

If a JSON object occupies multiple lines, you must enable multi-line mode for Spark to load the file. Files will be loaded as a whole entity and cannot be split.

### database data source

If running within the spark-shell use the --jars option and provide the location of your JDBC driver jar file on the command line.
spark-shell --jars ./mysql-connector-java-5.0.8-bin.jar

Once the spark-shell has started, we can now insert data from a Spark DataFrame into our database
