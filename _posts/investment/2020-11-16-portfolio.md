## definition

short term: < 5 years
mid term: 5-10 years
long term: 10-20 years

## accounts allocation 

**as of Nov 2020, derived from "case study for a person aged 57"**

- high interest saving account: cash for the next 5 years of living. 4k*5yr=200k

- RSP: interest oriented: bonds (15% of total portfolio), gold (5% of total portfolio). extremely risky speculation (2-3%)
- regular investment account (CAD): dividends oriented. 
- regular investment account (USD): high tech growth oriented， S&P500 index fund. hold in long term for 10-20 years. 
- TFSA: growth oriented. hold in long term for 10-20 years. 10% of total portfolio

percentage in portfolio: bond 15%, gold 5% | 60% dividends stocks | growth stocks 20% | extermely risky speculation 2-3% 

Bond: “You have a fixed income allocation for risk mitigation, as ballast to your overall portfolio,” “It serves a vital purpose there.” bond ETF

reinvest dividends. 

growth positions : hold them for next 10-20 years, the same horizon as owning a house. 拿不拿的住，敢不敢拿，幸存者偏差。

extremely risky speculation: short term speculation using option, Dama stock. 建议是新手每月拿200刀学习，亏了就不加。下月再加200刀玩。这样就完全没事. 玩这些波动性高的东西，要及时止损！亏一点钱不舍得跑，也许错过逆转，但是也避免全部损失.

rebalance the portfolio once a year. The buy and sell in rebalancing do not have to happen at the same time. 

## watch window

你选你心理感觉比较好的投资. 如果你对某只股票没有信心，很容易被震出来.

If I really have a urge to buy HIGH for a specific stock, open a Watch Window for the stock. its book value ranges from $1000 - $2000.

The purpose of watch window is to 
1) quench the urge to "buy high" since now I at least own a few shares of the stock even I bought it at high cost. 
2) give me more time to do research on the specific stock. dump the stock if I realize I made a mistake after research.
3) when the stock price continue rising, I made a few bucks. 
4) when the stock price drops, I buy more shares for long term holding if I still think the stock will grow well in long term. Or 


## USD is invested on high tech companies only

The industries includes: areospace, defense, IT software, IT hardware, gaming, bio pharmaceutical.

U.S. and international securities across a broad range of sectors using ETFs or index funds to achieve the desired diversification.


## CAD is invested on traditional companies


## take CPP after 65

Taking CPP early reduces the benefit amount by 0.6 per cent a month or 7.2 per cent a year. “It will be difficult to beat a 7.2-per-cent return on average in the markets.” So, using an apples-to-apples comparison, it would make sense for Stella to wait until 65 to take CPP.

## case study for a person aged 57

CLIENT SITUATION
The person: Stella, age 57

The problem: How to build a balanced and diversified portfolio. Figuring out how long her savings will last.

The plan: Set aside three to four years of cash needs in a high-interest savings account. Build a fixed-income component using some real return bonds. Gradually shift into U.S. and international securities across a broad range of sectors using ETFs or index funds to achieve the desired diversification. Use TFSA for growth stocks.

The payoff: A portfolio to last a lifetime with less risk than she is taking now.

Monthly dividend income: $3,600

Assets: TFSA $61,000; non-registered stock portfolio $860,000, share of residence $560,000. Total: $1.48-million

Monthly outlays (her share): Condo fees $450; home insurance $85; property tax $210; utilities $100; transportation $230; groceries $1,335; clothing $210; personal care $40; dining, entertainment $135; pets $25; health care $50; phones, TV, internet $200; gifts $20; vacation, travel $335. Total: $3,425

## Bond ETF

XSB, XBB, ZAG, VAB are broad-based bond ETFs. They offer real value in the context of what they do and how they compare with buying individual bonds. XBB holds 1,359 federal government, provincial and corporate bonds. Further diversification is provided by mixing bonds issued by companies at varying levels of credit quality (all meet the threshold of being investment grade, or financially solid) and bonds maturing in the short, medium and long term.

MER of XSB, XBB, ZAG, VAB funds: 0.08% ~ 0.10%

Someone investing for 10 years or more could buy a broad-based bond ETF like XBB, ZAG or VAB and be confident they have sensibly covered off their portfolio’s bond allocation with a single product.

If you could build your own portfolio of bonds through your online broker. Good luck with that. Brokers are notoriously uncompetitive in pricing bonds – they tell you what they’ll charge if you buy and what they’ll pay if you sell. Unlike with stocks, there is no open auction system where investors of all types bid against each other to set market prices.

ETF companies pay wholesale prices for bonds, not marked-up retail prices. The price paid for bonds is crucial because of the effect it has on yield. The more you pay for a bond, the lower your yield

A compensating advantage for individual bonds is that they eventually mature. No matter how much a bond fluctuates in price, you can expect it to be redeemed on a set date at its issue price. Bond ETFs are designed to keep rolling along, never maturing and thus subject to price declines when interest rates rise and price gains when rates fall.
