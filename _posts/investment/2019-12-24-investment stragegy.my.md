cash: 25%
Anti-inflation: 
    house: 25% (if I do not buy a house, invest it on A grade bonds)
    gold: 20% (ROE==inflationRate. hedge against systematic crisis, , which happens rarely, thus LT)
    tobacco or weed (soft gold): 5% (hedge against depresession)
    stock: 25%. 

Inside each category, diversify instruments. do NOT put all eggs into one basket.

Everyone has three 15 years' periods (3 * 15 yrs) to get rich in his life. last period is 2003-3019. If you catch anyone of the three, you will retire well.
