## Central banks will continue to print money at an unprecedented rate to provide liquidity

As long as the coronavirus continues to ravage the global economy, central banks around the world are going to print money at an unprecedented rate to provide liquidity. To do otherwise would almost certainly lead to a depression.

So, what should you be doing right now? As I have suggested in the past, maintain your focus on **high-quality, dividend-paying stocks**. Don’t be tempted by some of the extremely high yields we are seeing right now; the market is telling us those companies have financial problems and a dividend/distribution cut is possible. If the yield is more than 7 per cent, be very prudent.

The best sectors to focus on for dependable cash flow at this time are:  
 
- utilities, 
- telecommunications, 
- banks  
- consumer staples. 

But do your research, with special focus on balance sheets. **Quality first**. This is not a time to take flyers.
